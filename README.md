# techathon-bistro92
Smart table-based ordering system for Bistro 92 â€” Techathon Phase 1 submission.
## Section A: Quick Fixes

### Q1: Three Essential Features
1. **Real-Time Order Placement:** Customers can place their orders directly from the table, and the kitchen receives the order instantly.
2. **User-Friendly Interface:** The system should be easy to use for all types of customers, including tech novices.
3. **Order Customization Options:** Customers should be able to customize their food items based on their preferences.

### Q2: Two Design Principles for an Intuitive Interface

1. **Minimalist and Clean Layout:**  
The interface should have a simple design with limited buttons and clear labeling. Icons and text should be easy to understand, so even first-time users or older customers can navigate without confusion.

2. **Consistent Navigation and Feedback:**  
   The same buttons should always perform the same actions, and the system should provide immediate visual or sound feedback (like a beep or message) when an action is taken. This builds user confidence and reduces errors.
